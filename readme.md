## Pick my movie.

PMM is a movie website where you can see top rated movies and shows both by popularity and vote count.

You can also get a random movie if you have trouble picking a movie to watch.

This project is made only with vanilla javascript for practice and deeper understanding.

All information is fetched from [(https://www.themoviedb.org)]API.

I used SASS for styling for the same reasons.  
I've gotten pretty comfortable with css flexbox so now I will practice with css grids.
